    "Uber has introduced UberPool to make sure there are fewer cars on the road, which means less traffic, faster travel times and cheaper rides. Here is how UberPool works: it matches different riders heading in the same direction, giving a driver two pick-up and two drop-off locations on the same trip. UberPool is limited to two riders per trip, which means that sometimes a driver has to choose which request to accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a city represented as integer points on the Cartesian plane, with roads parallel to the axes. There's a driver who picked up a passanger at point A and is heading to point B with them, taking one of the shortest possible routes. When the driver reaches point C, she receives two more requests: one from a rider at point X, another from a rider at point Y. Both riders are also going to point B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find out which additional rider should be picked up (if any), taking into account that the final length of the trip can't be more than two times longer than the length of the trip with no extra riders. If both requests meet this condition, accept the one with the shortes route. If the lengths of the routws are the same, accept the first request."
